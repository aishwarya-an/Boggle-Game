## **About Boggle Game** ##
This is a word game which involves a board of jumbled up dice, where each die has a letter printed on top of it. The player has to build valid words out of the letters in the board according to the following rules :  
⦁ A valid word must be composed by following a sequence of adjacent dice — two dice are adjacent if they are horizontal, vertical, or diagonal neighbours.  
⦁ A valid word can use each die at most once.  
⦁ A valid word must contain at least 3 letters.  
⦁ A valid word must be in the dictionary (which typically does not contain proper nouns).  
The player accumulates the points according to the length of the valid words built.
